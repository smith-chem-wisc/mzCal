Software for calibrating mass spectra files based on identified peptides. The spectra files can be in the [mzML](http://www.psidev.info/mzml_1_0_0%20) format, or in the proprietary Thermo raw format. The identified peptides must be in an [mzIdentML](http://www.psidev.info/mzidentml) file. Only mzIdentML files produced by a [Morpheus](http://cwenger.github.io/Morpheus/) search (version 255 and above) are currently supported.

### Command Line Version Usage

The two required parameters are the paths to spectra and identifications files:
```shell
mzCal.exe spectra.mzML identifications.mzid
```

### GUI Version Usage

Drag and drop is supported for both spectra and identified peptide files. The spectra and identifications files must have identical names (but not extensions). Calibrations on multiple files are done in parallel.

## Requirements

In order to use Thermo raw files as inputs, please download and install the MSFileReader by creating an account at [https://thermo.flexnetoperations.com/control/thmo/login](https://thermo.flexnetoperations.com/control/thmo/login).

The following files must be present in the folder with the executable. If not, they are automatically downloaded (to update a file, delete it, and the application will download a new version). This is the only network usage by the software.
